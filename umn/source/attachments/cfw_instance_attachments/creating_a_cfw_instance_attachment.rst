Creating a CFW Instance Attachment
==================================

To create a CFW instance attachment for an enterprise router, you need to select the enterprise router when creating a VPC border firewall. Then the CFW instance attachment will be displayed in the attachment list of the enterprise router.

The VPC border firewall can control access traffic between VPCs and therefore protect the VPCs.

You need to create a VPC border firewall on the CFW console by referring to section "VPC Border Firewall Overview" in the *Cloud Firewall User Guide*.
