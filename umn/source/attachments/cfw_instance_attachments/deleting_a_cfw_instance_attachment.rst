Deleting a CFW Instance Attachment
==================================

A **CFW** instance attachment on an enterprise router cannot be deleted directly.

You need to submit a service ticket to contact the customer service to delete the CFW instance first. The CFW instance attachment will be deleted along with the CFW instance.
