Overview
========

Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users, for example, how many enterprise routers can be created, how many attachments can be created for each enterprise router, and how many routes can be added to each route table.

You can also request for increased quotas if your existing quotas cannot meet your service requirements.
