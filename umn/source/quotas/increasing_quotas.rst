How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota?
----------------------------------

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, call the hotline or send an email to the customer service mailbox. Customer service personnel will timely process your request for quota adjustment and inform you of the real-time progress by making a call or sending an email.

Before dialing the hotline number or sending an email, make sure that the following information has been obtained:

-  Domain name, project name, and project ID, which can be obtained by performing the following operations:

   Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the **My Credentials** page.

-  Quota information, which includes:

   -  Service name
   -  Quota type
   -  Required quota
