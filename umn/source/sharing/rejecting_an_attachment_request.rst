Rejecting an Attachment Request
===============================

Scenarios
---------

This section describes how to reject a request from another user for creating an attachment to your enterprise router.

.. note::

   -  If **Auto Accept Shared Attachments** is disabled on your enterprise router, you can choose to accept the attachment request or not.
   -  If **Auto Accept Shared Attachments** is enabled on your enterprise router, the attachment will be automatically accepted without your approval.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. Click **Service List** and choose **Networking** > **Enterprise Router**.

   The **Enterprise Router** homepage is displayed.

#. Search for the target enterprise router by name.

#. Go to the **Attachments** tab using either of the following methods:

   -  In the upper right corner of the enterprise router, click **Manage Attachment**.
   -  Click the enterprise router name and click **Attachments**.

#. In the attachment list, locate the attachment you want to reject and click **Reject** in the **Operation** column.

   The owner can also reject the attachment request. If the owner rejects the request, the attachment status changes from **Pending acceptance** to **Rejected**, and the attachment fails to be created. If this happens, contact the owner.
