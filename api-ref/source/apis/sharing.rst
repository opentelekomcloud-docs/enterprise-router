Sharing
=======

You can share an enterprise router in your account with other accounts.

-  You are the owner of the enterprise router.
-  Other accounts are the users of the enterprise router.

After you share your enterprise router with other accounts, these other users can attach their network instances to your enterprise router, so that their network instances can access your enterprise router.

.. important::

   Enterprise routers cannot be shared through APIs. You can only use this function on the management console. For details, see section "Sharing Overview" in the *Enterprise Router User Guide*.
